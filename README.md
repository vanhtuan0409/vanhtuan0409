Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a strong background in Computer Science foundation and Linux systems. My focus at the moment is backend and infrastructure system. I pay much attention in designing software interfaces and how components interact with each other. My experience which varied across multiple software fields (frontend, backend, and devops) helps me to create a more complete view on how software is created and how to work with people from different specialties. Aside from that, I love to automate stuff and create tools to make my daily job easier.

Currently I'm open for any partime, hourly jobs.
